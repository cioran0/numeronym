# numeronym.info
Numeronym.info webpage source in php. It's the source for webpage where you enter a word like "Accessibility" then it spits out A11y. Also has the top 15 or so numeronyms like a16z. 

I was annoyed at having to type these out. I may do something for discord timestamp soon too same ballpark. Ill probably do a VS code extension too. Sanitized input using special chars to prevent XSS.

The favicon is a calculator free for non-commercial use. License on this is non-commercial only. I changed the Font to paragraph from header for mob0ile compatibility.
Then I found bizarre autocomplete error on some phones, added note. I think some of them submit a blank string or something.
