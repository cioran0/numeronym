Hi this is Numeronym.info webpage source (in php). You enter a word like "Accessibility" then it spits out A11y. Also has the top 15 or so numeronyms like a16z. Basically the algorithm manipulates the user input string from the form and cuts it into substrings, counts the length of the middle one and then joins the front letter, back letter and that number together! Also has input sanitization with specialchars

I was annoyed at having to type these out. I may do something for discord timestamp soon too same ballpark. Ill probably do a VS code extension too. Sanitized input using special chars to prevent XSS.

The favicon is a calculator free for non-commercial use. License on this is non-commercial only. I changed the Font to paragraph from header for mob0ile compatibility.
Then I found bizarre autocomplete error on some phones, added note. I think some of them submit a blank string or something. 

It's high contrast colors for accessibility.
